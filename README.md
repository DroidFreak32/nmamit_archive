Contains only LAB exam programs.


## PART A


[01](https://github.com/DroidFreak32/mp_lab/blob/mse2/mse/p01.asm) - Search a key element in a list of ‘n’ 16-bit numbers using the Binary search algorithm

[02](https://github.com/DroidFreak32/mp_lab/blob/mse2/mse/p02.asm) - Write ALP macros: 

	a) To read a character from the keyboard in the module (1) (different file).

	b) To display a character in module (2) (different file).
	
	c) Use the above two modules to read a string of characters from the keyboard terminated by the carriage return and print the string on the display in the next line.

[03](https://github.com/DroidFreak32/mp_lab/blob/mse2/mse/p03.asm) - Sort a given set of ‘n’ numbers in ascending and descending orders using the Bubble Sort algorithm.

[04](https://github.com/DroidFreak32/mp_lab/blob/mse2/mse/p04.asm) - Read an alphanumeric character and display its equivalent ASCII code at the center of the screen.

[05](https://github.com/DroidFreak32/mp_lab/blob/mse2/mse/p05.asm) - Reverse a given string and check whether it is a palindrome or not.

[06](https://github.com/DroidFreak32/mp_lab/blob/mse2/mse/p06.asm) - Read two strings, store them in locations STR1 and STR2. Check whether they are equal or not and display appropriated messages. Also display the length of the stored strings.

[07](https://github.com/DroidFreak32/mp_lab/blob/mse2/mse/p07.asm) - Read your name from the keyboard and display it at a specified location on the screen in front of the message “What is your name?” You must clear the entire screen before display.

[08](https://github.com/DroidFreak32/mp_lab/blob/mse2/mse/p08.asm) - Compute the factorial of a positive integer ‘n’ using recursive procedure.

[09](https://github.com/DroidFreak32/mp_lab/blob/mse2/mse/p09.asm) - Generate the first ‘n’ Fibonacci numbers.

[10](https://github.com/DroidFreak32/mp_lab/blob/mse2/mse/p10.asm) - Read the current time from the system and display it in the standard format on the screen.

[11](https://github.com/DroidFreak32/mp_lab/blob/mse2/mse/p11.asm) - Program to simulate a Decimal Up-counter to display 00-99.

[12](https://github.com/DroidFreak32/mp_lab/blob/mse2/mse/p12.asm) - Read a pair of input co-ordinates in BCD and move the cursor to the specified location on the screen.


## PART B

[01](https://github.com/DroidFreak32/mp_lab/blob/mse2/mse/p13.asm) - Read the status of eight input bits from the Logic Controller Interface and display ‘FF’ if it is even parity bits otherwise display 00. Also display number of 1’s in the input data

[02](https://github.com/DroidFreak32/mp_lab/blob/mse2/mse/p14.asm) - Perform BCD up-down counter using the Logic Controller Interface.

[03](https://github.com/DroidFreak32/mp_lab/blob/mse2/mse/p15.asm) - Perform Ring counter using the Logic Controller Interface

[04](https://github.com/DroidFreak32/mp_lab/blob/mse2/mse/p16.asm) - Read the status of two 8-bit inputs (X & Y) from the Logic Controller Interface and display X*Y.

[05](https://github.com/DroidFreak32/mp_lab/blob/mse2/mse/p17.asm) - Display messages FIRE and HELP alternately with flickering effects on a 7-segment display interface for a suitable period of time. Ensure a flashing rate that makes it easy to read both the messages.


[06](https://github.com/DroidFreak32/mp_lab/blob/mse2/mse/p18.asm) - Assume any suitable message of 12 characters length and display it in the rolling fashion on a 7-segment display interface for a suitable period of time. Ensure a flashing rate that makes it easy to read both the messages

[07](https://github.com/DroidFreak32/mp_lab/blob/mse2/mse/p19.asm) - Display system time in a seven segment display.

[08](https://github.com/DroidFreak32/mp_lab/blob/mse2/mse/p20.asm) - Drive a Stepper Motor interface to rotate the motor in clockwise direction by N steps (N is specified by the examiner).Introduce suitable delay between successive steps.

[09](https://github.com/DroidFreak32/mp_lab/blob/mse2/mse/p21.asm) - Drive a stepper motor interface to rotate the motor in anticlockwise direction by N steps (N is specified by the examiner). Introduce suitable delay between successive steps.

[10](https://github.com/DroidFreak32/mp_lab/blob/mse2/mse/p22.asm) - Drive a stepper motor interface to rotate the motor by N steps left direction and N steps right direction (N is specified by the examiner). Introduce suitable delay between successive steps.

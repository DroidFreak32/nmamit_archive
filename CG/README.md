## TODO: Important functions


### Program List

01. Program to implement Mid Point Line Algorithm. The line coordinates should be specified by the user.

02. Program to implement Mid Point Circle Algorithm. The radius should be specified by the user.

03. Program to implement the Cohen-Sutherland line-clipping algorithm. Make provision to specify the input line, window for clipping and viewport for displaying the clipped image.

04. Program to implement Liang-Barsky line clipping algorithm.

05. Program to fill any given polygon using scan-line area filling algorithm.

06. Program to recursively subdivide a triangle to from 2D Sierpinski gasket. The number of recursive steps is to be specified by the user.

07. Program to create a random figure and rotate it about a given fixed point using transformation matrices.

08. Program to create a random object and to implement the suggested mouse and keyboard interactions through OpenGL function.

09. Program to draw a color cube and spin it using OpenGL transformation matrices.
